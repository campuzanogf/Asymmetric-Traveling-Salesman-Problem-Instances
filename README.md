# The Drone-Assisted Variable Speed Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem Instances

A repository with instances for the ATSP-D and VS-ATSP-D

The ATSP-D and VS-ATSP-D are extensions of the classic Travelling Salesman Problem, where a drone with different speed levels sits on top of a truck. The drone can either move with the truck, or fly somewhere. Therefore, these problems focus on studying the truck-and-drone delivery operations to serve a given set of customers, where asymmetric transportation times are intrinsically generated by the combination of features, such as wind effect, parcel weight, and variable drone speeds.

Comments within an instance's file start with /* and end with */ have to be ignored.
