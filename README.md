# Asymmetric-Traveling-Salesman-Problem-Instances
ATSP-D-Instances
A repository with instances for the TSP with Drones

The ATSP with Drones (or ATSP-D) is a variation of the classic Travelling Salesman Problem where a drone sits on top of a truck. The drone can either move with the truck, or fly somewhere. However, the drone can only cover a single node before it has to return to the truck. Coupling or decoupling happens at a node and requires both vehicles to synchronize, thus waiting can occur.

Comments within an instances file start with /* and end with */ and have to be ignore by a parser.

Currently this repository only contains Geometric Instances.

This repository contains the instances used for the paper XXX.

In the 1.3 version of the repository, we also added uniform instances of sizes 10 to 20 that we solved in the paper Dynamic programming approaches for the traveling salesman problem with drone.
