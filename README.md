# Variable Speeds Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone Instances

A repository with instances for the VS-ATSP-D with Drone

The VS-ATSP with Drones (or VS-ATSP-D) is a variation of the classic Travelling Salesman Problem, where a drone with different speed levels sits on top of a truck. The drone can either move with the truck, or fly somewhere. Therefore, the VS-ATSP-D focuses on studying the truck-and-drone delivery operations to serve a given set of customers, where asymmetric transportation times are intrinsically generated by the combination of features, such as wind effect, parcel weight, and variable drone speeds.

Comments within an instance's file start with /* and end with */ and have to be ignored by a parser.

Currently, this repository only contains a modified version of the single-center instances from: https://zenodo.org/record/1204676#.YX_6fJ7MJaR

This repository contains the instances used for the paper "The Variable Speeds Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone".

In the 1.4 version of the repository, we also added uniform instances of sizes 10 to 20 that we solved in the paper The Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone. Campuzano Giovanni, Lalla-Ruiz Eduardo, & Mes Martijn. DOI:
