# Variable Speeds Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone Instances
VS-ATSP-D-Instances
A repository with instances for the VS-ATSP-D with Drone

The VS-ATSP with Drones (or VS-ATSP-D) is a variation of the classic Travelling Salesman Problem where a drone with diffferent speed levels sits on top of a truck. The drone can either move with the truck, or fly somewhere. However, the drone can only cover a single node before it has to return to the truck. Coupling or decoupling happens at a node and requires both vehicles to synchronize, thus waiting can occur.

Comments within an instances file start with /* and end with */ and have to be ignore by a parser.

Currently this repository only contains a modified version of the single center instances from: https://zenodo.org/record/1204676#.YX_6fJ7MJaR

This repository contains the instances used for the paper ""The Variable Speeds Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone".

In the 1.3 version of the repository, we also added uniform instances of sizes 10 to 20 that we solved in the paper The asymmetric traveling salesman problem with drone. Campuzano Giovanni, Lalla-Ruiz Eduardo, & Mes Martijn. DOI: . 

You are kindly requested to cite these papers if these instances are relevant to your research.
